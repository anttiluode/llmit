# LLMit

LLMit is a Reddit-like web application that dynamically generates and displays posts and comments using a locally hosted AI model.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Posts and comments are generated in real-time by an AI model.
- **Sub-LLMit Groups**: Similar to Reddit's subreddits, LLMit groups categorize content.
- **Sorting**: Posts can be sorted by "Top" or "New" based on upvotes or creation time.
- **Customizable**: Users can create new groups and customize the appearance and behavior of the site.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- OpenAI API client
- LM Studio (running as a server)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLMit.git
   cd LLMit
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the LM Studio in server mode:
   Ensure that your LM Studio is running as a server to serve the `populate_db.py`.

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python initialize_db.py
   ```

   This script creates the necessary database schema, preparing it for populating with content.

5. Generate content for the database:
   ```bash

   This script will generate posts and comments for all the sub-LLMit groups, including "AskLLMit".
